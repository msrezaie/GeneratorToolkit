# Web Generator Toolkit
Web Generator Toolkit is a Django web app that consists of several tools, including a generating emails app, a user generating app, and an app for converting YouTube videos to MP3 and MP4 formats.

## Features
Web Generator Toolkit consists of three main apps:

### YouTube Converter
YouTube Converter allows users to input a YouTube video link and convert it to either an MP3 or MP4 file. The app provides options for selecting the quality of the MP4 file, and returns a download link for the converted file.

### Email Generator
Email Generator allows users to generate a list of email addresses with random passwords. Users can select their preferred email domain (e.g. Gmail, Outlook) and input the number of email addresses they wish to generate.

### User Generator
User Generator allows users to input a list of email addresses and select a platform (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) to generate usernames for. The app generates usernames based on the email addresses, and returns a list of usernames with randomly generated passwords.
